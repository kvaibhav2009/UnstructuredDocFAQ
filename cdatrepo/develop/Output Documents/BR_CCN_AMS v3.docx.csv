9,"Accenture will be responsible for overall management of the Transition and to the extent within its control, will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Transition on schedule.

The Transition Services will begin on the date mutually agreed between the Parties at the time of execution of this Statement of Work and will continue for a period of 2 months. The payroll transfer will be completed not later than 6 weeks from the start of transition and the date of payroll transfer which will be the date of commencement of steady state services will be mutually agreed between the Parties. The end of the transition period will be marked by sign off by both parties of a set of defined deliverables (Transition Plan Deliverables)"

52,Section B: Services Specification
53,B-1. Service Baseline
54,The service baseline sets out the general scope of steady state services as outlined below:
55,Steady State Services
56,The following application maintenance and support services (Steady State Services) will be provided by Accenture:
57,Infor M3 support - Application management and support for the M3 modules that are being supported by the i3 team at the time of this Statement of Work:
58,"Finance, Manufacturing, General Procurement / Items, Planning, MDM, COP, Warehousing, PDE, Fusion, Inventory, Technical, Reporting"
59,~1600 M3 users
60,Non-M3 and Legacy applications support as below:
61,61 Applications currently being managed by I3 as listed in Section E
62,The list of the above applications being supported by the In-Scope Brandix Personnel will be re-confirmed during transition
63,"Accenture will work with the Brandix IT team to evaluate rationalization of these applications, where possible"
64,"Routine enhancements and developments (Minor Enhancements) - The available capacity in the support team will be managed by Accenture for servicing tickets, CRs, on-going enhancements and other improvements; based on the defined SLAs. During Transition, a detailed process will be defined for estimating, reviewing, approving and implementing new enhancements (change requests), including setting up of a Change control board"
65,The service workload will be established during stabilization (post transition) and the Parties will jointly define the process for demand management (in-coming work)
66,"To the extent possible, Accenture will deliver support services (resolve bugs, service requests and other routine maintenance tasks) and enhancements by managing the bandwidth within the team. However, additional manpower may be required for major enhancements or development initiatives such as new application systems development, implementation of other ERP modules, other 3rd party software implementations, version upgrades, integrating any acquired companies resulting in significant development or system integration work, etc. Such additional manpower requirements would be the subject of separate arrangements through the Change control procedure; post approval from the Brandix stakeholders. The change control procedure will be as set forth in Schedule  S of the Agreement and will be tailored, if needed, for this scope of services during Transition"
67,"The above Steady State Services would be provided by the In-Scope Brandix Personnel rebadged to Accenture as provided in Section D. In total, Accenture would provide 50 resources, as listed in Section D, for application maintenance services to Brandix in the first year. Accenture would drive productivity improvement and plans to reduce 1 resource each contract year starting from year 2 until year 5. The team would resolve calls and implement enhancements based on their available bandwidth. Accenture would endeavour to reduce effort on support activities (fix on fail) and move the bandwidth that becomes available for discrete enhancements and projects."
68,"Services Stabilization: Accenture will introduce service delivery experienced resources during the first 6 months to drive the change and establish best practices in delivery of application maintenance and support services. In addition, Accenture will conduct quarterly reviews and training intervention, if needed, during year 1 to enable the In-Scope Brandix Personnel to imbibe the metrics based service delivery culture"
69,The service window of operations will continue to be the same as is being provided by the In-Scope Brandix Personnel at the time of transition. 
70,"Unless otherwise agreed to by Brandix and Accenture in writing, the above describes Accentures complete scope of Steady State Services."
71,Accenture Senior Management supervisory support
72,Accenture Senior Management would be involved periodically throughout the duration of the contract to:
73,"Participate in the Joint Review Board (JRB) meetings, to provide the necessary guidance and expertise"
74,Review performance of Steady State Services as per agreed SLAs
75,Monitor the engagement and review quality compliance
76,"Manage the IT team, and assist in making available requisite skills within the team"
77,"Bring in the necessary subject matter expertise from time to time, whenever deemed necessary and agreed between the Parties"
78,Accenture will conduct quarterly quality review of the Services and discuss summary findings with the JRB.
79,Governance structure
80,There will be 2 layers of Governance in addition to the user level periodic interaction on day to day tasks.
81,"IT Steering Committee: The objective of the IT Steering Committee is on strategic decisions and monitoring of the application services engagement with Accenture. This is a common committee for reviewing status and discussing initiatives on technology and related operations. The steering committee composition would be finalized during Transition and would be made up of senior management from Accenture and Brandix, including the Accenture Delivery Lead and Brandix IT head. The IT Steering Committee would meet on a quarterly basis during the first year of the engagement and post that, the committee would decide on the frequency of the meeting. The IT Steering Committee members would also participate in the overall JRB meetings on the Accenture engagements review"
82,"IT Operational Review Committee (ORC): The focus of the ORC is on operational monitoring and review of the technology operations.

83,New Projects  & Incremental Services
84,"Brandix and Accenture agree that over the duration of the , new projects may need to be implemented to provide additional benefits to Brandix in line with the business strategy. These projects could arise out of business functional requirements, mergers or acquisitions, setting up new operating locations or just increased scale of business. The projects would be identified and evaluated on an on-going basis and will be executed based on Brandixs business priorities, available budget and expected timelines, after getting approval from Brandix management. The effort and cost for such projects will be estimated by Accenture and will be mutually agreed upon with Brandix. The implementation of such projects is at Brandixs discretion; and would follow the change control procedure set forth in Schedule  S of the Agreement."
85,Brandix business volume growth
86,"The scope defined earlier in this section and the pricing in Section B includes regular, organic business growth of Brandix. Organic business growth would consist of increased transactions, and number of employees due to regular revenue expansion. The total IT support workload would be established during the SLA baselining / stabilization period. A steady increase of workload for 3 consecutive months above the limit finalized during the baselining period would justify a re-baseline of the same. At the end of every year of the Statement of Work, the JRB will evaluate the workload and projections for the next year to determine if any resources need to be added. If the JRB decides that additional resource(s) are required for the later years of the engagement; the same will be deployed at additional cost. "
