In such cases, the Benchmarking provider will negotiate together and individually with each Party and make a proposal for resolving the situation. The final decision on changing the prices and/or other possible actions will be made according to the Governance Model, at a sufficiently high escalation level. It is of the Parties intent that the new prices based on the Benchmarking project will be used within 90 days from receiving the Benchmarking results."
